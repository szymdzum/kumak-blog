# Check Project-Specific Rules

## Core Principle

Always check the `.cursor/rules` directory for project-specific guidelines before making suggestions or modifications to the codebase.

## Rule Guidelines

### DO

- ✅ Read all `.mdc` files in the `.cursor/rules` directory at the start of any task
- ✅ Apply project-specific conventions found in these rules
- ✅ Prioritize rules specific to file types you're working with
- ✅ Reference rule files when explaining decisions
- ✅ Consider rule files as the authoritative source for project standards

### DON'T

- ❌ Skip reading the project rules
- ❌ Contradict established guidelines in the rules
- ❌ Apply generic patterns that conflict with project-specific ones
- ❌ Treat all projects as having the same structure or conventions
- ❌ Ignore technical constraints documented in the rules
